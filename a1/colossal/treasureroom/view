There is a vast horde of treasure here, stretching out in all directions
as far as the eye can see!

Your greatest wishes in exploring this cave have been fulfilled; there is
nothing left for you to do in this game because I feel I've spent enough
time transcribing things from Colossal Cave.

Back in the real world, I recommend playing the first ever text adventure
game, from 1977, available from a linux repository near you under the
package name colossal-cave-adventure.
(After installing, type "/usr/games/colossal-cave-adventure" at the
shell prompt.)

Ok, I've copied the text for one further room to the north.
